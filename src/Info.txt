Things to fix:

	-Reduce number of calls to Board.clone() (And re-do the debug variable when you get home)
	-Don't convert moves from string to [] to square notation - settle on one form and use it (Add debug variable)
	-Look into making isInCheck() faster
	-Go home and record benchmarks and averages so you have points of comparison
	

All benchmarks should be run with NO programs running and all threads in the Debug tab closed
Use the following move string: "position startpos moves e2e4"

BENCHMARKS ON 4/6/13, NO OPTIMIZATIONS
	-Depth 3: Anywhere from 6500 to 7200
	-Depth 4: Min was 50s, Max was ~80, but most values were around 60s
	-Cloning takes up about 40% of all time
	
4/7/13: Took out A LOT of references to clone().  A byte[][] variable is actually a pointer.  I'm looking into how we can remove more calls to clone()
	-Depth 3: ~1900 ms
	-Depth 4: ~ 19.5 s
	-Cloning down to about 2-3%
	-Testing was done after a fresh reboot, 4/6 benchmarks may be innaccurate, nonetheless a lot of saving was done
